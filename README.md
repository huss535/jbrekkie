# Japanese Breakfast â€” Website Redesign

A personal project where I redesigned the official Japanese Breakfast website as a creative and UX-focused exercise.

## ðŸ”§ What I Did
- Recreated the official site **for fun** as a web design challenge  
- **Streamlined the UX** into a single, linear experience  
- Replaced individual videos with a **centralized video carousel**  
- Built entirely using **Vanilla JavaScript**
